http://www.scientology.org/ (This is the most similiar site I could find to my topic, except mine isn't a cult. It's an organization that promotes acceptance and equality through a system of paid ranks that just happens to be run by a central entity. Not a cult. )

This site is relatively easy to navigate. And despite the content being the result of a malicous entity known for the destruction of lives, i'm not immediately revolted by the website. Specifically the menu is easy to navigate and the content is straightforward.

Html elements I recognize: Header, property, href link, body, src, style, table (td and div), and and unordered list. 

It's extremely difficult to tell what any of these html elements could possibly be because there is just so much going on. One of the easier ones is definitely margin_left which I'm assuming creates a left margin! I'm fairly familiar with padding and margins form a brief period of messing around in Android Studio.
